# InstagramAppHW1

* a description of the project (citing the original YouTube tutorial)

The purpose of this project is to practice creating a project using the Rails environment and to inspire myself to begin experimenting with it. Secifically, the project is an Instagram copy that allows the user to post pictures. I used the YouTube tutorial found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE

* properly captioned screenshots of the main functionality you implemented
